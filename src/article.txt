You may not need Redux
Before Considering a state managent library
â˜‘  Before using Context...

A few months back, i started using react, most of us can relate as to how it gets messy when
your app gets bigger because you tend to keep passing down props till it gets to the inner 
components thats needs it.

                     Level1 
                        Level2 
                           Level3 
                              ...
Though This is Fine as it is just the way react works. but we wouldnt want a behemoth of
of unmaintainable code. so  we would usually reach out to state management 
libraries(REDUX/MOBX)/The New Context API ðŸ˜œ its getting old now. There are millilons of tools
nowadays that will  blow your mind but you've  gotta know  when to use them and you'll be fine
not knowing when to use them makes you take longer than expected on a project while trying
to understand how context, Redux or Mobx works or other libraries in general.


Componets Composition
______________________
You can escape "props drilling" by passing down components as props so the components has
the data it needs before its being passed  down as prop.
for the purpose of demonstartion we would build a $30BILLION app ðŸ˜œ 
.yea you heared me right.

The App Structure will look like:

<App>
  <PageLayout/>
     <NavigationBar> 
        <Avatar/>
      </NavigationBar>
   <PageLayout/>
</App>
 
 Here the avatar component needs a user prop followthe traditional way we would keep passing
 down a user prop till it gets to ````<Avatar>``` like so

<App>
  <PageLayout/>
     <NavigationBar> 
        <Avatar/>
      </NavigationBar>
   <PageLayout/>
</App>
